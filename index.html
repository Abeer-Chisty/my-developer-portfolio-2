                <h3><span>2020-Present | Pro Level Photo editor</span></h3>
                <p>I am the master of Photoshop. I can work at Adobe Illustrator too. I love to play with colors and
                    seeing everything from a new angle. Though I don't have a good connection with drawing but still the
                    journey is so far so great. I can edit your pictures pretty well and in a new dimension! </p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. It was fun working at Programming Hero. I can
                    even make a personal Portfolio and as a new learner, I am doing great in their course!</p>
